## HISTORY OF ERP


- A Timeline of ERP: Transforming Business Operations ERP has revolutionized modern businesses, but its roots lie in a quest for efficiency. Let's explore its journey.

- MRP(Material Requirements Planning): The Seed is Sown (1960s-1970s) Large manufacturing giants like Boeing grappled with managing materials, production, and inventory. Enter MRP, the first step towards integrated planning. It optimized material usage, minimizing waste and production bottlenecks.

- ERP Emerges: Unifying the Orchestra (1980s-1990s) MRP evolved into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), expanding its scope beyond materials. Finance, HR, sales, and more joined the symphony, sharing data and processes through a single, unified system. Early vendors like SAP and Oracle established themselves as pioneers.

- Tiered Evolution: Solutions for Every Tune (2000s-present) ERP diversified to cater to diverse needs. Tier 1 players like Microsoft and Oracle still cater to multinational giants, while Tier 2 solutions focus on specific industries like manufacturing or finance. Smaller, simpler Tier 3 options emerged for smaller businesses.
